OpenZotacZone Bazzite Image for the Zotac Zone Handheld
This project builds a custom Bazzite image for the Zotac Zone gaming handheld with integrated OpenZotacZone drivers, 144 Hz & HDR fixes, improved fan control, and a preinstalled Decky Loader with a curated plugin set.

Why this image?
OpenZotacZone drivers installed via build.sh or manual scripts are only temporary: after kernel updates they must be rebuilt and reinstalled.

A custom Bazzite-based image makes these drivers persistent – they survive system updates, reboots, and rebases within the Universal Blue / bootc workflow.

Built upon:
Zotac-specific adjustments from: https://github.com/Reed-Schimmel/ZotacBazzite
The official Universal Blue image template: https://github.com/ublue-os/image-template
​
Image Features:
